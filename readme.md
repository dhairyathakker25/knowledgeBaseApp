This project is a simple CRUD service developed with spring boot and 
JPA and exploring one to many relationship.

**Motivation**

I am come from QA background and have done testing around API's 
but always wanted to explore dev side of API and spring boot turns out to be a 
popular choice.

can be changed in application.properties using ./gradlew bootrun
It is also dockerized now so can be run as docker-compose up and terminated using docker-compose down

2. Unit Tests using Junit and Mockito
3. Functional/Integration test
4. Performance Test using Gatling
5. Liquibase
6. deploy to K'8 cluster on EKS.
